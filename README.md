Try Scheme
==========

Code and exercises from our session looking at the [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) language.

Code can be written online using something like [Repl.It](https://repl.it/languages/scheme), or with a locally installed environment such as [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) or [Gambit](http://gambitscheme.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).

The details can be found somewhere in the [LCD Events Archive](http://leedscodedojo.github.io/archive.html).
